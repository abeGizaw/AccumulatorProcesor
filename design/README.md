Design Directory
--------------------------------------
Put your design documents and journals in here. You can put other design-related documents (green sheets, etc) in here too.  Don't put Xilinx projects or any implementation artifacts in this directory.

Your Design Document should be a single document that you update each week.  You will not have multiple design documents (the one you make will grow).  Same with the journals.

For more information, see:
https://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse232/Project/

Include:
* DesignDocument.pdf 
  - You can include a .docx or .tex file in here too, but there MUST be a pdf file of the up-to-date version committed each week.
  - At the beginning of this document, include a link to your google document or whatever collaborative editing tool you are using (if you are using one)
* Journal-[username].pdf (your individual journals, replace [username] with your username, each team member makes one of these)
  - The same as the other document, .docx are fine to include here, but you MUST include an up-to-date pdf committed with each milestone.
  - Document things you work on alone and how much time you spend on them.
  - Document things you decide as you make design decisions: why you chose certain designs, things that went wrong, etc.
